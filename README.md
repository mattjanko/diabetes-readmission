# diabetes-readmission

Project synopsis: Medical data sets can be very complicated, with some columns representing hundreds or thousands of nominal features. Given such a complex data set, weâ€™d like to reduce the dimensionality of the data in order to be able to apply prediction algorithms more efficiently. Using data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, we develop a column transformer that implements principal component analysis and k-means clustering so as to maintain prediciton performance with dimension reduction of more than 95%.
